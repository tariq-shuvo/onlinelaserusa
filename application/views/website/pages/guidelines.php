                <h6>Design Guidelines</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">OnLine Laser is made to be a simple process to get your laser cut parts fast. Simply design your part and upload it and enter the basic information and we take it from there. Because laser cutting metals and other materials is complex, the process is greatly improved if your design file is properly prepared for laser cutting.  All you need to know are some basic rules to make your design perfect.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <h6>Getting Started</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">Very Important: Open paths are a “laser stopper”. Close your Paths. The laser cannot figure out how to close the path and cut accordingly so we will need to make the necessary file repairs in order to process the part.   Also remove any duplicate lines. If your file has duplicate lines, the laser will see them, but we won’t, and the line will be cut twice, resulting in distorted part edge from the added heat. The cut time will also be increased if there are double lines. Always double check your file to close your paths and remove duplicate lines.</p>

                <h6>Maximum and Minimum Part Size</h6>
                <ul class="text-muted">
                    <li>OnLine Laser Metal Cutting Service can produce laser cut parts in a maximum cut size of 60″ x 120″.</li>
                    <li>For our online purchase and shipping service the maximum parts size is limited to 23.5” x 23.5”. This size is best suited for packaging and shipping to ensure parts arrive in good condition at an economical shipping cost.</li>
                    <li>If you need larger parts, just contact us at quotes@onlinelaserusa.com and we will get you taken care of.</li>
                    <li>Contact us for orders requiring higher quantities. We will work with freight carriers to achieve the best overall transit costs with crated or palletized packaging. quotes@onlinelaser.com</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-muted"><strong>Minimum part size</strong> is 1” x 1”. Can smaller parts be cut? Yes, but for our online automated laser cutting service, this minimum size keeps the process efficient. Small parts will be tabbed into the blank using “microjoints” (.010” – .035”) and shipped to you. You will remove the parts from the blank so be careful, those tiny parts can bend easily if they are too small. They will also have small burrs left behind from the micro-joint, which is easily removed.   For parts smaller than 1”, contact us at quotes@onlinelaserusa.com</p>

                <h6>Laser Kerf – Set at 0.00</h6>
                <ul class="text-muted">
                    <li>Kerf is defined as the width of material that is removed by a cutting process. It was originally used to describe how much metal was removed by the laser beam. Some vector editors have this value as a modifiable user input. You must set this parameter at 0.00” so you upload the exact part you want cut. Our machine will define Kerf value depending on the material thickness and cutting conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <h6>Thin Parts, and High Temperatures</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">While you are designing, keep in mind that your design is a three dimensional object that is going to be processed by an industrial CNC machine that will use a high-power laser that melts, burns, or vaporizes material, and is blown away from the part by a jet of gas, leaving an edge with a high quality surface finish. Sharp acute outer corners can melt the material and result in a poor quality cut. Thin lines can melt or distort. As a general rule of thumb:</p>
                <ul class="text-muted">
                    <li>Keep all holes and cutout areas (including text) a minimum width of 1.5x – 2x material thickness.</li>
                    <li>Any cutouts smaller than the material thickness will not have favorable cutting performance and may not be accurate due to the thermal effects from the laser beam</li>
                    <li>Apply a small radius (.020” or bigger radius) on inner and outer corners</li>
                    <li>Avoid geometry that has sharply acute angles where the part is paper thin at the point. Design part width using 1.5x -2x material thickness or more for best results.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <h6>Minimum distance between parts</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">As a general rule, keep the distance between parts about 2x the material thickness. For example, if you are using .074” (14ga) cold rolled steel (CRS), then use .148” distance between parts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <h6>OnLine Laser Quote Configurator</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">Our online laser cutting quote configurator is designed with simplicity in mind so that you are able to instantly request a competitive price for laser cutting services. Upload your file, fill in the information and we will respond within 24 hours with a price. Please take into account the 4 parameters needed for our configurator to work effectively when ordering. (Use “Inch” in your dimensions.  It just works better that way)</p>
                <ul class="text-muted">
                    <li>Material Type: Select the material you want for your design. Currently OnLine Laser offers Cold Rolled Steel (CRS), Stainless Steel (304 SST) and 5052 Aluminum. (Coming soon, brass, copper, and other finishes, check back often)</li>
                    <li>Material Thickness: The thickness determines the depth of the part. It is a key factor that will affect the cutting time, rigidity, weight, and price of your laser cut parts.</li>
                    <li>Dimensions:   Overall length and width are key values in the configurator. We think of this as x, y dimensions so if you draw a box around the entire length and width (x, y) area of the part, those overall dimensions are the dimensions you enter into the configurator.</li>
                    <li>Path Length: Path length refers to the total sum of the length of all cut lines that make up your design. This total distance of cut paths to draw your part is what will be calculated to determine the laser cutting processing time, and the total cost of laser cutting your part.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <h6>How to find the total path length of your part:</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">For Adobe Illustrator Users: Go to window>document info. On the pop up pane, select the dropdown and choose “objects”. Now select your object and note the path length. You can change the units from mm to inch at “Preferences>Units>General”. Remember to check the stroke in “Outline” mode (Win: ctrl+y | Mac: cmd+y). In case your part contains text, create stroke lines, in “Type>Create Outlines, which will convert the font into lines. Always “ungroup” all lines (select all + right click)</p>
                <p class="text-muted">AutoCad Users: There is no tool in AutoCad to find overall path length, but you can upload the TLEN.lsp routine. If you are not familiar with the use of lisp routines, you can go to this helpful youtube link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkLRr3xyDNo</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <h6>Outline Check</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">This applies only to Illustrator users: Always remember to do a check in outline view Win: Ctrl+Y | Mac: Cmd+Y. Stroke thickness is not considered an object, so always outline strokes and text.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">To outline strokes select your path and then go to Object > Path > Outline Strokes For text, Right Click on your text and select Create Outlines.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <h6>File Types</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">We prefer DXF more than anything else. But you can also upload your file in .AI, .SVG or .DWG format without issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <h6>Common Gotchas</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">Minimum hole sizes depending on stock thickness<br>Try to avoid designing tiny holes as it might be impossible for the laser to cut through. Keep a note of the following:</p>
                <ul class="text-muted">
                    <li>Min. hole diameter for .039″ thickness = .098″</li>
                    <li>Min. hole diameter for .059″ thickness = .118″</li>
                    <li>Min. hole diameter for .078″ thickness = .157″</li>
                    <li>Min. hole diameter for .118″ thickness = .256″</li>
                </ul>
